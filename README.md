# California-Wine-Value-Prediction
Capstone project
California is the Golden State when it comes to wine, it produces 90% of all of the wine made in United States. If California was a country, it would be the fourth-largest wine producer in the world behind France, Italy and Spain. The climate, the coastline and the very ground itself are the three major geographical features that contribute to the excellent California wine production.

The aim of this project is to forecast the value of county wine for the future. Linear regression model was used at first, result came out fine. Next, Lasso regression model and Ridge regression model were used to regularise to see if there will be any improvement. As another option, Neural network regression was also used in this project.
